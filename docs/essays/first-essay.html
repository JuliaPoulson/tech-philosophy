        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Beauty and Stillness</h1>
        <p class="mt-4">I observed a tree in the Cambridge Commons while considering the sentence: “If, by contrast, we have surrendered to the enjoyment of genuine beauty, we are at such a moment in equal degree of our passive and active powers, and we shall with equal ease turn to seriousness or to play, to repose or to movement, to compliance or to resistance, to the discursions of abstract thought or to the direct contemplation of phenomena.” (Schiller, Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man, 149)</p>

        <p class="mt-4">I allowed my focus on the tree to be briefly interrupted by the noticing of the confused expressions of passersby. It occurred to me that what I was doing was considered strange; in modern society, one searches for entertainment, not play. What was there to see in this tree? What was the tree doing for me? What was weird about my sitting and looking, I think, was that I was engaging with something unchanging; the tree wasn’t doing anything. I considered typical forms of entertainment – television, social media – whose purpose is to transform before your eyes. When one scrolls on Instagram, one is not meant to maintain focus on anything static, but instead treats attention as a moving object, and attempts to hold a consistent rate of movement between their attention and the content. If a video is paced too slowly, one’s mind wanders, and if one scrolls at a rate higher than their attention is traveling, one might notice that they don’t remember anything they watched for the past five minutes.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">I had been wondering what Schiller would think about the modern person’s typical forms of aesthetic engagement, and I think in this idea of the movement of attention I found my answer. I believe the mix of passive and active forces which arise from play, the state of determinability, are born in some sense from the stillness of the interaction. When in front of a moving screen, one must exercise no active powers, for the movement of the attention is the action in itself. When allowing one’s attention to roll about like a marble on a table maze, no active energy is needed. One can simply observe, be fully submissive to the object of attention. You don’t have to actually bring yourself to the interaction. You, specifically, are not needed; any marble will do just fine to roll about on the surface of a screen.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">This is distinct, however, from the process Schiller describes of determinability, in which one opens themselves up to beauty and allows it to flow into them. In this process, you are indispensable. To really encounter beauty, one needs to be still with it. The faster the movement of the attention, the higher the friction between the person and the object, and the less the two can truly seep into one another. Put another way, it’s a matter of being present, of being in oneself, instead of being in the thing. When you are in the thing, this is nothing more than sensual experience. In order to truly encounter beauty, you need to be unafraid to sit in stillness with it, even if that means you must sit with yourself as well.</p>
