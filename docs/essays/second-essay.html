        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">The Built World & The Existential Gap</h1>
        <p class="italic text-gray-700">“Egotism itself, which is so necessary to a proper sense of human dignity, is entirely the result of indoor life.” (Wilde, The Decay of Lying, 4)</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Humans, like all other animals, once occupied a world that was indifferent to us. Sitting on the cold earth and gazing up at my tree, it occurred to me that humanity's defining innovation was arguably the creation of indoor heating. For most of human history, the primary goal of life was survival, but in my day-to-day, the issues of gathering food and retaining warmth have a triviality that would be unfathomable to any human living before 500 years ago. I feel compelled to ask: if survival isn't my life's purpose, then what is?</p>

        <p class="mt-4">What strikes me more than the question itself, though, is that I feel like no one ever warned me about this gaping hole at the core of the modern human world! I just had to violently fall into it, face first, my sophomore year of college. How did that happen? Why wasn't every adult in my childhood grabbing my shoulders and saying “You don't understand now, but human self-consciousness is the most inexplicably remarkable phenomenon in the universe and it will take you your entire life to figure out what any of this means”?</p>

        <p class="mt-4">I think one reason might relate to the egotism of the built environment that Wilde talks about in this excerpt. Because we are inheriting the physical structures of the generations before us, there's a false understanding that we also inherit their intellectual and philosophical progress, and, while this is largely true on a societal level, it's totally false on an individual level. I was born into a hospital with electric lights, air conditioning, and advanced medical equipment - the result of hundreds of thousands of years of collective human progress. Yet as I took my first breath, none of humanity's intellectual achievements were passed on to me. There's a disconnect between the inherited material of modern life and the intellectual and existential gaps that remain for each individual to confront. The comfort of the built environment may insulate us from immediate physical dangers, but it does nothing to shield us from the overwhelming vastness of existence itself - a vastness we must each grapple with anew.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">The indoor world we have crafted makes complete sense in its own terms. Governments function, planes fly, televisions broadcast - all of it can be studied and rationally understood. Yet this sheet of human society drapes itself over a natural world, concealing an unfathomable vastness and leaving us estranged from the incomprehensible that sits beneath. I feel incredibly competent in my ability to navigate the built world, but at the same time I feel like an infant in my understanding of what underlies it. Maybe I always will. In some way, this class feels a bit like preschool; like I am for the first time encountering the shapes and colors and textures of philosophy, of the natural world and of humanity's place in it. So even though it was long overdue, I am really grateful to have taken this first step, so to speak.</p>
